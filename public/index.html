    <!-- Basics about origami-->
    <p class="paragraph-section">
      Origami is a hobby I got into for over a year and it is so much more than a 12-step crane. For the basics, most people need
      to know the difference between a:

      Origami requires a few requirements to make more of the professional models such as large square-shaped paper that is thin.
      Everyone has their own preference on origami paper and certain kinds of paper are better on certain models than others.
      A model that I have infamously been unable to make is Satoshi Kamiya's Crane, which requires the thinnest kind of paper
      known as tissue paper. Other models such as one's representing mammals or mythological creatures, which are more top
      heavy, may require paper that is more robust such as tissue-foil paper. Methylcellulosis, a type of adhesive glue which
      binds within the paper, can be used to keep models tightly in their shape; this is especially useful for models based
      on bugs.

    <!-- History of origami-->
    <p id="history-paragraph-style">
      Every model has their different allure, some artists create simpler models for cuteness or elegance, while others have models
      that are hundreds of steps to accurately portray the fine details of a certain species of animal. There are so many
      origami artists in the world and they are have their own style of folding; for example origami artists from China and
      Vietnam are coined for the pleat-fold, which are a series of folds creating the resemblance of scales. Spanish and
      American artist fold models prominent in muscle structure. Some of my favorite artists are Roman Diaz, Satoshi Kamiya,
      and Brian Chan.

    <!-- MY history with Origami-->
    <p id="my-history-paragraph-style">
      I first made simple models like the Pajarita, crane, or frog, but eventually I got hooked to the more distinguished models.
      There are famous magazines such as the Origami Tanteidan that are released every month (along with conventions held
      every year), which reveal diagrams to follow for certain models from artists. Acquiring these magazines catalyzed my
      progress. I made a 60-step bird from Satoshi Kamiya to a 135-step Hippocampus from Roman Diaz, which took me three
      days to make. The hardest model I ever made was a 185-step owl by this famous vietnam artist. Alas, I have wasted many
      a paper never able to make Satoshi Kamiya's 100-step Crane.
