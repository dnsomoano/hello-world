  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <header>Origami</header>
  <section>
    <p> Origami is a hobby I got into for over a year and it is so much more than a 12-step crane. For the basics, most people
      need to know the difference between a:
      <ol>
        <span class="foldType">Mountain Fold</span> - A fold made away from you.</ol>
      <ol>
        <span class="foldType">Valley Fold</span> - A fold made toward you.</ol>
    </p>
    <p>Origami requires a few requirements to make more of the professional models such as large square-shaped paper that is
      thin. Everyone has their own preference on origami paper and certain kinds of paper are better on certain models than
      others. A model that I have infamously been unable to make is Satoshi Kamiya's Crane, which requires the thinnest kind
      of paper known as tissue paper. Other models such as one's representing mammals or mythological creatures, which are
      more top heavy, may require paper that is more robust such as tissue-foil paper. Methylcellulosis, a type of adhesive
      glue which binds within the paper, can be used to keep models tightly in their shape; this is especially useful for
      models based on bugs.</p>
    <p> Every model has their different allure, some artists create simpler models for cuteness or elegance, while others have
      models that are hundreds of steps to accurately portray the fine details of a certain species of animal. There are
      so many origami artists in the world and they are have their own style of folding; for example origami artists from
      China and Vietnam are coined for the pleat-fold, which are a series of folds creating the ressemblance of scales. Spanish
      and American artist fold models prominent in muscle structure. Some of my favorite artists are Roman Diaz, Satoshi
      Kamiya, and Brian Chan.</p>
    <p>I first made simple models like the Pajarita, crane, or frog, but eventually I got hooked to the more distinguished models.
      There are famous magazines such as the Origami Tanteidan that are released every month (along with conventions held
      every year), which reveal diagrams to follow for certain models from artists. Acquiring these magazines catalyzed my
      progress. I made a 60-step bird from Satoshi Kamiya to a 135-step Hippocampus from Roman Diaz, which took me three
      days to make. The hardest model I ever made was a 185-step owl by this famous vietnam artist. Alas, I have wasted many
      a paper never able to make Satoshi Kamiya's 100-step Crane.</p>
