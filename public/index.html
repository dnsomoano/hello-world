    <p> Origami is a hobby I got into for over a year and it is so much more than a 12 step crane. For the basics, most people
      need to know the difference between a:
      <ol>
        <span class="foldType">Mountain Fold</span> - A fold made away from you.</ol>
      <!-- TODO fix strong tag into css-->
      <ol>
        <span class="foldType">Valley Fold</span> - A fold made toward you.</ol>
      <!-- TODO fix strong tag to css-->
      <p> Origami requires a few requirements to make more of the professional models such as large square-shaped paper that
        is thin. Everyone has their own preference on origami paper and certain kinds of paper are better on certain models
        than others. A model that I have infamously been unable to make is Satoshi Kamiya's Crane, which requires the thinnest
        kind of paper known as tissue paper </p>
      <p> Every model has their different decree, some artists create simpler models for cuteness or elegance, while others have
        models that are hundreds of steps to accurately portray the fine details of a certain species of animal. There are
        so many origami artists in the world and they are have their own style of folding; for example origami artists from
        China are coined for the pleat-fold, which are a series of folds creating the ressemblance of scales.</p>
